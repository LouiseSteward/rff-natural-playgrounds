# **Tool 7** Formulating Objectives
{:.icon-pencil}

Formulate smart objectives by describing exactly what you want to achieve.

## When do you use the Formulating Objectives tool?

Someone once said, ‘If you don’t know where you are going, how will you know that you got there?’

Well-formulated objectives lead to successful, measurable projects. When you have established the priority issues that you want to address in your project, you need to formulate an objective for each one of those priorities.

## Who can use the Formulating Objectives tool?

-   Individuals
-   Groups or teams
