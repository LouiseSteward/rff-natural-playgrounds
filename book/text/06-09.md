## How do you use the Monitoring Summary tool?

Just as cars have indicators to show the direction you are going, projects need indicators to show the direction it is going.

Performance indicators monitor that activities are completed during implementation of the natural playground.

{% include definition term="Objective" class="non-printing" %}

For each **objective**{:data-term="Objective"} and activity, identify the indicators needed to measure progress, the way that you will check this indicator, how often you will check it and when it should be completed by. Do this by completing the prompts in the tool below.

For multiple objectives you can {% if site.output == "web"%}[download and print out the worksheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/monitoring-summary.pdf){:target="_blank"} to fill it in by hand or you can {% elsif site.output == "app" %}[open and print out the worksheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/monitoring-summary.pdf){:.download-pdf} to fill it in by hand or you can {% endif %}copy the prompts onto a piece of paper and write down your answers.
