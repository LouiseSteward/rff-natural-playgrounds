# **Tool 1** Partner Finder
{:.icon-users}

Find out who cares about your community or school by defining who has an interest or investment in it.

## When do you use the Partner Finder tool?

Communities are not just groups of people that stay in the same area, they can also be groups with a common interest like a school or workplace or people that live elsewhere but have an interest in the area like business owners, organisations or government departments.

Defining your community helps you to decide who should be involved or can contribute to your natural playground Needs Assessment with manpower, resources, perspectives, experience, expertise, and insights.
